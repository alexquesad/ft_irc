# ft_irc

FT_IRC is a project that consists of creating an IRC server in C++.

An IRC server is a computer program that allows users to connect and communicate with each other in real-time using the IRC protocol. It allows users to join channels, send messages, and perform various other actions.

The server will be capable of managing channels, users, private messages, and IRC commands.
